# Welcome to Heardle unlimited

I recreated the famouse game Heardle so you can play it with your own songs!
  1. Download the repo and access it via Terminal
  2. pip install -r requirements.txt # Execute to install the dependencies
  3. Copy your songs into the music folder. You can have subfolders if you want to switch between different music playlists, just make sure to include the name of the folders you want to skip in files/config.py -> SKIP_FOLDERS = ["ListA"] 
  4. python Heardle.py # To start the game

Note: The app will read filenames, so make sure both artists and song names are included.

Enjoy :)
